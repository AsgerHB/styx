VERSION 1

BLACK SCREEN

Passenger:

I didn't do it, okay?

Passenger:

I DIDN'T DO IT!


A crackle and sizzle pass through the air.

The black screen fades out and charred, smoking man sits on the boat.


Passenger:

I didn't do it...

Charon:

What?

Passenger:

I didn't kill her.

Charon:

I believe you...

Passenger:

The jury didn't. They sentenced me to life in prison. I was 18!

Passenger:

That wasn't fast enough, so they sent me to the chair.

Charon:

You were not executed for her death. 

Passenger:

No, that was... That was something else.

Passenger: (hell 1)

Look, you wouldn't be the first to think I belong in hell.

Passenger: (hell 1)

But you don't know the whole story.

Charon:

I know all...

Passenger: (hell 1)

Then you know that prison is a dog eat dog world.

Passenger: (hell 1)

The dogs were circling and I wasn't to wait around for their bite.

Charon:

...

Passenger: (hell 1)

I wasn't even supposed to be in jail in the first place!

................

Passenger: (heaven 1)

Ah, you understand. Good.

Passenger: (heaven 1)

When we get to heaven, I'll take care of you.

Charon:

As you took care of your partner?

Passenger: (heaven 1)

I...

Passenger: (heaven 1)

He was a necessary sacrifice.

Passenger: (heaven 1)

When you fight a war, brothers become soldiers.

Charon:

All in the service of power.

Passenger: (heaven 1)

Spoken like someone who's always had it.

.................

PASSENGER (HEAVEN 2)

Look, I'm not saying I'm perfect but...

PASSENGER (heaven 2)

What do you do when a random stranger tries to hold you down?

Passenger: (heaven 2)

You make him stop.

Passenger: (heaven 2)

You make sure he can't try again.

Passenger: (heaven 2)

He wasn't supposed to die though.

Charon:

But he did.

Passenger: (heaven 2)

Well, I wasn't supposed to go to prison, but here we are.

...................


Passenger: (hell 2)

Understand, I have been under somebody's boot my entire life.

Passenger: (hell 2)

My father, then the prison system... and then finally Isac.

Passenger: (hell 2)

Until one day I snapped.

Passenger: (hell 2)

Isac may have been a monster, but I had sharper teeth.

Passenger: (hell 2)

Once the dust settled, hell became a paradise... For me.

Passenger: (hell 2)

I felt powerful, in control.

Charon:

What about shame?

Passenger: (hell 2)

I was done suffering.

.....................

Charon (HEAVEN):

We're arriving at salvation.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

I'll believe it when I'm there.


Passenger: (heaven 3)

...

Passenger: (heaven 3)

Why did that stupid bastard have to try and stop me?

Passenger: (heaven 3)

When he grabbed me, I just saw them.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

My father, the judge, Isac... Those spineless prison bastards.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

I lost control. He didn't even make it to the hospital.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

Only took a couple of weeks to get the death sentence. 

Passenger: (heaven 3)

I knew the exact date of my death and I could do nothing to stop it.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

...

Passenger: (heaven 3)

I've suffered enough, haven't I?

.....................

Charon (hell):

We're arriving at damnation.

Passenger: (hell 3)

Honestly, what did you expect of me?

Passenger: (heaven 3)

I admit, I haven't lived the cleanest life. But, how could I?

Passenger: (heaven 3)

My entire life has been covered in filth.

Charon:

You could have washed it clean.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

The prison? I was just a man!

Charon:

You were a king.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

...

Passenger: (heaven 3)

Hahahaha!

Passenger: (heaven 3)

So was Isac, so was the bastard that replaced me.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

But you're right.

PASSENGER (HEAVEN 3)

I should have saved them from the hell they created for themselves. 

Passenger: (heaven 3)

It is a burden, us, the powerful must bear: compassion.

Passenger: (heaven 3)

Don't you agree, ferry man?

.......

Ends in heaven.

Passenger: (heaven 4)

I'm finally home.

........

Ends in hell

Passenger: (hell 4)

It will never end, will it?
